# nohup man_page info

If  standard  input is a terminal, redirect it from an unreadable file.
       If standard output is a terminal, append output to 'nohup.out' if  pos‐
       sible,  '$HOME/nohup.out'  otherwise.  If standard error is a terminal,
       redirect it to standard output.  To save output  to  FILE,  use  'nohup
       COMMAND > FILE'.

       NOTE:  your  shell may have its own version of nohup, which usually su‐
       persedes the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's doc‐
       umentation for details about the options it supports.
